# Build a library of things that can fail

Now that you have a Maybe type, you need to use it.  So now use it to build
safe versions of several common functions specified by the prelude.

    headMay :: [a] -> Maybe a
    tailMay :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
    lookupMay :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
    divMay :: (Eq a, Fractional a) => a -> a -> Maybe a

The divMay function should return Nothing if you're dividing by zero and
result of the division otherwise.
