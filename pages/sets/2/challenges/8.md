# Build a library of things that can fail

Now that you have a Maybe type, you need to use it.  So now use it to build
safe versions of several common functions specified by the prelude.

    headMay :: [a] -> Maybe a
    tailMay :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
    lookupMay :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
    divMay :: (Eq a, Fractional a) => a -> a -> Maybe a

The lookupMay function is kind of like the lookup for a map.  Find the first
tuple in the list where the first element is the equal to the passed in value
and return the second element.  If there is no matching 'a', then return
Nothing.  The divMay function should return Nothing if you're dividing by zero
and result of the division otherwise.
