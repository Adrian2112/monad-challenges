# Handling Failure

You may have noticed that MCPrelude doesn't have the Maybe type or anything
from Data.Maybe.  That's because you're going to build it all yourself.

**IMPORTANT**
Again, it is imperative that you DO NOT CHEAT.  Don't look at any of the Maybe
stuff from Prelude or Data.Maybe.  Don't do it.  Nobody is forcing you to do
these exercises, so you should try to get the maximum possible benefit.
**IMPORTANT**

First of all, you need to define the Maybe type.  This type needs to represent
failing values of any type, so it needs a type variable similar to what we saw
in the Gen type alias.  But this can't be a type alias because it has two
constructors.  Write this type yourself and get it to compile.  Once you've
gotten it compiling, check your answer by hex decoding the following:

    64617461204D617962652061203D204E6F7468696E67207C204A7573742061

You should use this definition and names going forward.  We just wanted you to
work on it yourself first.
