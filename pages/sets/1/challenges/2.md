# Random Character Generation

Now use the rand function to make your own function for generating random
letters of the alphabet.  It should only generate lower case letters a-z.

    randLetter :: Seed -> (Char, Seed)

Now use this function to generate a random string of three letters.  When you
rot13 this string you get the string "yes".
