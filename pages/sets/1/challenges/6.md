# Generalizing Pairs Even More

Your generalPair function in exercise #4 cas be generalized even more.
Instead of always constructing pairs, you should be able to have a
generalization that can construct anything.  All you need to do is pass in a
function that does the constructing.  Call this even more generalized function
generalB.  Once you have it implemented, write a new generalPair2 function in
terms of generalB.
