# Monad Challenge Set 3

In this set we are going to investigate lists.  As usual, make sure you have
the following at the top of your code file.  If you don't do this, you might
inadvertently solve these problems in a way that misses the whole of the
exercise.

    {-# LANGUAGE MonadComprehensions #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE RebindableSyntax #-}
    
    module Set3 where
    
    import MCPrelude
