# Monad Challenge Set 1

It may not seem like the problems in this set have much to do with monads at
first, but bear with us.  We are taking you through the motivations for monads
in a step by step structured way.  It may be tempting to skip over this stuff.
DON'T DO IT.  Later problem sets build on things you did here.  Stick with us
and try to absorb the ideas and patterns.
