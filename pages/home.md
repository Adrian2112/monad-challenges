# The Monad Challenges

## Welcome

The guys who wrote the [matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
realized that you cannot get a working knowledge of crypto without investing
blood, sweat, and tears into playing with and attempting to break crypto.
They even say, "But more people 'know how' to break it than can actually break
it."  Their crypto challenges provide a structured way for people to make the
requisite blood, sweat, and tears investment to get to a place of
understanding.  We believe the same is true when learning monads.  The problem
with monad tutorials is that it is impossible for another person to _explain_
monads to you.  You must explore them yourself.  You will never really
understand monads until you use them in real world situations.  The problem is
that beginners do not usually know what things to do to build that
understanding.  We put together this set of challenges to help you do just
that.

_Please do NOT publish the answers to these challenges._  Reading answers that
you did not create yourself defeats the whole purpose.

### Do I need to know category theory?

No.

### Do I need to know Haskell?

Yes, we assume that you have some beginner "pre-monad" level knowledge of
Haskell including basic syntax and knowledge of type signatures.  We are not
trying to teach you Haskell here.  We are trying to teach you monads.  If you
need to learn Haskell, go work through some beginning Haskell materials and
come back when you think you need to learn monads.

### Organizing Your Code

It will probably help if you organize your code into one file per set of
challenges.  Some of the problem sets build on previous ones, so it will be
convenient to be able to easily import your code for a whole set or find it
for reference.
