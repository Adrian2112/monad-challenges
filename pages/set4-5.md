# Fitting permutations in

When we constructed our Monad type class we only used the patterns seen in
sets 1 and 2.  Now try to fit set 3 into the Monad type class as well.  You
will need to make an instance of Monad for [].  Then figure out how to
implement the permStep function in terms of return and bind.
